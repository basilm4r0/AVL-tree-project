A university course database management system implemented using the AVL Tree data structure.


The program supports the following functionality:
  1. Reading a file named courses.txt file and creating the tree.
  2. Inserting a new course from the user with all its associated data.
  3. Finding a course and updating of its information.
  4. Listing courses in lexicographic order with their associated information (credit hours, IDs, and topics).
  5. Listing all topics associated with a given course.
  6. Listing all courses in lexicographic order that belong to the same department.
  7. Deleting a course.
  8. Deleting all courses that start with a specific letter.
  9. Deleting all courses belong to a given department.
  10. Saving all words in file offered_courses.txt
  

The structure of one line of input in courses.txt is as follows:
```
Course:CreditHours#CourseCode/topic1, topic2, ..., topicN
```
